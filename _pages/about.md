Hi! My name is Xinyu Chen (CN: 陈心语). I'm a third-year Master's student in **Statistics** at the University of Science and Technology of China, luckily supervised by [Prof. Xinyu Zhang](http://homepage.amss.ac.cn/research/homePage/dc8f0ecc0eb548d88443b15d46ca8569/myHomePage.html). Prior to that, I got my Bachelor degree from Beijing Institute of Technology.
